#Time complexity
- This is what the concept of asymptotic runtime, or big O time, simply means caculation of algorith run time.
- What is the meaning of asymptotic ?
  - It means approaching a given value or condition, as a variable or an expression containing a variable approaches a limit, usually infinity.

  O  Big O
  --------
  - Describes the upper bound on the time.

  Ω Big Omega
  ----------- 
  - Ω is equivalent concept but for lower bound.

  Θ Big theta
  -----------
  - Θ means both Big O and Big Omega. Big theta gives a tight bound on runtime.
